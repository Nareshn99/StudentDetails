# StudentDetails

1. Create a login screen.
2. After logging in the student list will appear with filters(name, subject) and
add/edit/view/delete.
3. While adding a student with the student and subject combination that
already exists in the database then include the marks in existing marks.
otherwise, it will create a new student record.
